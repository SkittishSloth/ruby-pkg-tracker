# Package Tracker

The main goal for the app is to allow tracking updates and additions for different package managers, like `apt` or `homebrew`. With homebrew, I like seeing the new and updated formulas and casks - I've discovered a lot of useful apps that way. But, once you run it once, you lose those changes next time you run it - if you close your window, you're SOL. And on my work laptop, IT will often run `brew upgrade` in the background to ensure the system is up to date - I completely miss any changes there.
